        Lubumbashi, DRC
    </h1>
    <p>
        I love Lubumbashi, a beautiful city with beautiful night light, in the southern part of the Democratic Republic
        of Congo.
    </p>
    <p>
        The city is located closer to the country of Zambia and it's an important economic hub, for Zambia and also for
        the whole of the Congo. As i have been traveling to different cities within our region, I have come to love this
        city even more because of its' beauty and uniqueness.
