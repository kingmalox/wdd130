            I am currently creating a crypto arbitrage bot using AI. I started from scratch five months ago and hope
            to finish it in a few months. This bot is designed to analyze the market, find arbitrage opportunities on
            multiple exchanges, display them, and even execute trades for several different users.

            The Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) is a landlocked country located in the heart of Africa,
            renowned for its rich biodiversity and vast tropical rainforests. It is one of the few places in the world
            where wild bonobos, our closest great ape relatives, can still be found thriving in their natural habitat.
            These remarkable primates, known for their peaceful and social behavior, inhabit the dense forests of the
            Congo Basin, making DR Congo a critical region for wildlife conservation and ecological research.
